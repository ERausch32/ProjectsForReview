Hello, my name is Eric Rausch.

The following are projects that I have participated in to demonstrate programming concepts that I have learned.  Some of the projects were done as a pair programming exercise.  Most contain template code that was given to us, either to provide something we hadn't explicitly learned, or to just "get us started."

* TEnmo-ClientServer-wk8-pair-exercise:
	Payment Service Simulator - Developed a client-server application, as a pair, using Rest protocol to interact with an ASP.NET based API using the MVC design pattern.   Began exploring TDD and functional programming as a way to further develop SOLID programming principles.   Project also explored using the interaction between RestSharp, ASP.NET, and JSON to protect & validate data requests, with an emphasis on using Postman to initiate an attempted security breach.  Majority of content in classes specifically related to password generation/authentication were provided at project start.

* Excelsior_Vnues-DAO_SQL-wk6-pair-exercise:
	Reservation Manager - As part of a pair, created a command-line reservation manager using C#/.Net & MS SQL.  Project focused on maintaining encapsulation while interacting with a user and a database using queries of various complexity.  Emphasized using loosely coupled code by defining a minimum viable product (MVP) and then adding features once the MVP passed integration testing.

* Excelsior_Venues-additional_features_refactoring_post_project:
	This began where the prior Excelsior Venues project ended.  This add-on project, done solo at a later time, added additional features and refactoring to the code to gain additional experience in SOLID programming principles.
