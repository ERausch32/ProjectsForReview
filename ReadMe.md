Hello, my name is Eric Rausch.

The following are project that I have participatedin to demonstrate programming concepts that I have learned.  Some of the projects were done as a pair programming exercise.  Most contain template code that was given to us, either to provide something we hadn't explicitly learned, or to just "get us started."

TEnmo-ClientServer-wk8-pair-exercise:
	This project was a pair exercise.  It brought together the concepts of REST, APIs, Security, and using Postman to test server interaction.  It was written in C#/.Net using RestSharp, ASP.Net, MSSQL, & MS Test.  My partner & I attempted to use Test Driven Development, SOLID Programming, and also explored various concepts of functional programming.
